## âš¡ Project Overview

A **Type-I PLL** uses a phase detector, a simple loop filter, and a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO).  
This project simulates the complete Type-I PLL system and validates its locking behavior.

- **Tool used:** LTspice (or equivalent SPICE simulator)  
- **Focus:** Locking performance and output verification
